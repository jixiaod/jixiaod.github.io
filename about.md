# 👋 Hi there! I'm Ji Gang (jixiaod / 老虎)
 
* 📍 I was born in 1986 and grew up in a [rural area in Fushun](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ovTSHZNGp6kgetXY7), Liaoning Province, China.
* 🎓 In 2006, I started studying Software Engineering at [Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai)](https://www.hitwh.edu.cn/) and graduated in 2010.
* 🏢 Worked at a few second-tier internet companies and currently [freelancing](https://100dos.github.io/).
* 📝 I don't write [blog posts](https://jixiaod.github.io/) too much, but write [Weibo](https://weibo.com/jixiaod) from time to time
* ⚙️ I don't really enjoy programming; I hope to make enough money quickly to enjoy the rest of my life
